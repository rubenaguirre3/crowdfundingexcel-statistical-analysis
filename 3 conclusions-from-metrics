The data we have here is very informative and provides some insights on what seems to generate success and what kind of project will not generate you success.
For example, if you notice the 3 top successes all relate to each other, theater, music, film, & video, the trend seems that you should associate with compatible industries
just like how music, film, and video are essential to a production set which makes sense.. producing a potentially good film with the right team can land you success. 

However, a dichotomy presents itself when you look at the amount of failures. it also takes the lead making it a risky endevour to venture on especially for the inexperienced.


There is a 64.42% success rate, but a 36.4% failure rate, and without the right budget and people, failing is more likely.

However, there is one other category in this data set that will go overlooked if you don't pay attention closely that is much better in reality because the numbers do not lie.

Journalism is the only category with a 100% success rate, although the amount of projects is smaller in comparison, it takes 3 different industries to achieve 64.42% success rate.
