Statistical Analysis of why using a median calculation is a better visualtion of successful vs failed projects

Upon running the mean calculation and median calculation, I noticed a discrepancy that was very apparant.



To further elaborate on that discrepancy, the total number of successful crowdfunding projects is 565 according to the data I pulled from the parent category columm S1 on the "crowdfunding sheet". I created a pivot table in the "category statistics sheet" to make the data much more easier to analyze and the ability to filter out information. When I ran the mean function on the number of successful projects, I was returned with a value "851.1469" which stood out immediately to me, if 565 projects were successful backed up by data, how can on average 851.1460 projects be even feasible? Even more concerning is the mean value for failed projects which returned me "585.6154".


Aside from that discrepancy, the mean value in this situtation does not accurately represent this data like how the median actually does.

I ran the following calculations to backup my assertion that the median value is a much more accurate representation of the success vs failure metrics. First I will list the values to make it easy to understand. All this data can be referenced in the pivot table on the "category statistics sheet" & the data in the "Mean median mode" sheeton the excel file in my revised commitment.

**Sum of all success's = 565**
**Sum of all failures = 364**

Mean (Successful) = 851.1469027
Mean (Failed) = 585.6153846

Median (Successful) = 201
Median (Failed) = 114.5

565(success) - 364 (fail) = 201 

201 / 565 = 35.58%

364 / 565 = 64.42%

64.42% + 35.58% = 100%

I started my analysis by first calculating the difference of both successful & failed projects which resulted in a value of 201 which represents the median value of successes.
201 represents is a net represenatation of how many projects actually do succeed as 565 successful projects is very misleading because the figure does not take into account any failed projects.

To compensate for that, I divided 201 by 565 and ended up with a 35.58% success rate.

Finally, to further reinforce my assessement, I need to calculate the failure rate, you can simply just do 100%-35.58% giving you a 64.42% failure rate or you can divide the amount of total losses by the amount of total success's giving you the same exact numbers proving why the median statistic is a much more realistic representation backed up with simple calculations.

35.58% + 64.42 = 100%
