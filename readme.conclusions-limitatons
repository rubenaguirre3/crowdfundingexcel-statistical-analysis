The data we have here is very informative and provides some insights on what seems to generate success and what kind of project will not generate you success.
For example, if you notice the 3 top successes all relate to each other, theater, music, film, & video, the trend seems that you should associate with compatible industries
just like how music, film, and video are essential to a production set which makes sense.. producing a potentially good film with the right team can land you success. 

However, a dichotomy presents itself when you look at the amount of failures. it also takes the lead making it a risky endevour to venture on especially for the inexperienced.


There is a 64.42% success rate, but a 36.4% failure rate, and without the right budget and people, failing is more likely.

However, there is one other category in this data set that will go overlooked if you don't pay attention closely that is much better in reality because the numbers do not lie.

Journalism is the only category with a 100% success rate, although the amount of projects is smaller in comparison, it takes 3 different industries to achieve 64.42% success rate.


Limitations:

The data is feel is not enough to paint an accurate picture, as the categories are way to broad and can mean anything, the top 3 categories are very niche and vary by skill level
dramatically especially since the most successful in those projects more than likely have the capital support a quality production set and team and in a way disenfranchises smaller
players trying to make into this cut throat industry, it'll miselead most people into thinking that its the best thing you can do when its in fact pretty difficult and expensive.

I feel that the live stats should not count until after the project and canceled stats should go under failures since music, theater, and film dominate that section as well, if it had counted
for the latter the success rate would decrease, but on paper it projects the idea that its a good venture. I feel that a line graph over 5 years will show performance over time
and make it easier to spot trends, get into to them, and leave them strategiclly just like how it happens on social media,=.
